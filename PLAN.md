# Creature Sandbox - Development Plan

## Active

- [ ] Evaluate tool favorites / quick swap UX (post-brush-size update)
- [ ] Audit save/load UX for surfaced feedback (non-intrusive)

## Session Audit (2026-01-24)

### 10 most visible rough edges (inspection)
1. Overflow menu lacked in-context help after condensation.
2. Save/load hotkeys documented but not implemented for file downloads.
3. Selected creature card disappeared entirely when nothing was selected.
4. Icon-only quick actions relied on hover tooltips (not visible on mobile).
5. Mobile pan/zoom felt overly sensitive and jittery.
6. Mobile keyboard could cover inputs in panels.
7. Ecosystem health updated every frame (overkill on mobile).
8. Pointer move path created new objects each event.
9. Export actions had no confirmation feedback.
10. Menu mapping for condensed HUD was not visible in-app.

### Top 3 performance hotspots (inspection)
1. Per-frame ecosystem health recalculation in `GameLoop.updateSubsystems`.
2. Frequent UI updates for stats/selected info even when unchanged.
3. Pointer move allocations during continuous panning.

## Session Audit (2026-01-25)

### Focus
1. Creature feel upgrades (personality reactions + selection feedback).
2. Session nudges for manual spawns.
3. Home screen tone polish.

## Next

- [ ] Expand ECS stub for batch processing if needed
- [ ] Prototype creature presets panel for sandbox quick starts

- `creature-sim/src/ecs.js` — Created stub to fix missing import (P0 blocker)
- `creature-sim/src/renderer.js` — Removed duplicate `timeOfDay`/`dayNightSpeed` assignment (lines 44-46)

- `creature-sim/src/mobile-support.js` — Fixed high-DPI coordinate bug, changed `console.log` to `console.debug`
- `creature-sim/src/game-loop.js` — Fixed duplicate import, changed startup logs to `console.debug`
- `eslint.config.js` — Created ESLint 9.x flat config (replaces legacy `.eslintrc.json`)
- `package.json` — Updated ESLint to ^9.0.0, added globals ^15.0.0, updated lint scripts
- `.eslintrc.json` — Removed (replaced by flat config)
- All source files — Auto-fixed trailing whitespace and formatting issues

- `creature-sim/src/input-manager.js` — Routed paint/spawn/erase through ToolController and wired Cmd/Ctrl+Z / Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+Z to undo/redo

**Why:**
- App would fail to load due to missing ES module imports (`batch-renderer.js`, `ecs.js`)
- Duplicate property assignments shadowed config values from RendererConfig
- Startup logs cluttered browser console; now use `console.debug` (hidden by default)
- Keyboard shortcuts were undiscoverable; help overlay improves UX
- Mobile double-tap zoom was misaligned on high-DPI screens (used canvas buffer size instead of CSS size)
- ESLint 9.x uses flat config format; legacy `.eslintrc.json` no longer supported
- Added undo/redo so accidental spawns/erases/food paints can be reversed safely

**Verified:**
- `npm test` — Save system tests pass
- `npm run lint` — 0 errors, 80 warnings (unused vars only)
- HTTP 200 from local server
- Mobile audit: touch handling, responsive CSS, coordinate conversion all good
- `npm test` — Save system tests pass after undo/redo changes

**Performance Audit:**
- Renderer has frustum culling (creatures outside view are skipped)
- Zoom-based detail reduction (shadows, trails, names disabled when zoomed out)
- Clustering throttled to ~4Hz, skipped when zoomed out
- Analytics throttled to every 5 frames
- World updates throttled to every 30 frames
- No performance issues identified for 500+ creatures

**Notes:**
- PLAN.md created as per CLAUDE.md requirements
- Full codebase audit complete (see invariants below)
- Keyboard help accessible via `?` key (mentioned in home page footer)
