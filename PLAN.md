# Creature Sandbox - Development Plan

## Active

- [ ] Add tutorial tooltips for UI elements (hover tooltips explaining buttons/controls)
- [ ] Complete smoke test verification in browser (now use `npm run dev` instead of python http.server)
- [ ] Verify core loop: spawn → select → interact → save/load
- [ ] Verify mobile touch controls work correctly

## Session Audit (2026-04-15, Session 17 - Smooth Camera Transitions)

### Focus
Improve camera following to use easing instead of snapping for smoother tracking.

### Changes

**creature-sim/src/camera.js:**
1. Added easing functions to `_ease()` method:
   - `easeOutCubic`: existing (1 - (1-t)^3)
   - `easeOutQuad`: (1 - (1-t)^2)
   - `easeInOutCubic`: t < 0.5 ? 4t^3 : 1 - (-2t+2)^3/2

2. Modified `update()` method to apply easeOutCubic to lerp factor:
   - Changed `const t = 1 - Math.pow(1 - this.smooth, Math.min(dt * 60, 1));`
   - To `const rawT = ...; const t = this._ease('easeOutCubic', rawT);`
   - This provides natural deceleration as camera approaches target

3. Adjusted `smooth` parameter from 0.14 to 0.08:
   - Original smooth=0.14 gave ~14% per frame linear lerp
   - With easeOutCubic, effective lerp is ~22% per frame (slightly snappier)
   - Combined with easing, provides smooth catch-up without rubber-banding

### Verified
- `npm run lint` — 0 errors, 0 warnings
- `npm test` — 146 passed, 0 failed

### Notes
- Frame-rate independent via dt*60 scaling (unchanged)
- Existing pan/zoom functionality preserved (uses same lerp)
- Travel system continues to use easeOutCubic for smooth animations
- Camera now decelerates naturally when approaching targets, reducing rubber-band feel

## Session Audit (2026-04-15, Session 16 - Ambient Ecosystem Sounds)

### Focus
Add dynamic ambient sounds based on ecosystem health and time of day.

### Changes

**creature-sim/src/audio-system.js:**
1. Added `playEcosystemAmbient(world)` method:
   - Reads ecosystem health from `world.ecoHealth?.metrics?.overall`
   - Reads time of day from `world.dayNightState`
   - Calculates predator ratio to determine tension level
   - Selects appropriate ambient sound type based on health + time + tension

2. Added `playEcosystemSound(type, volume)` method:
   - `peacefulDay`: Happy birds chirping (multiple layered chirps)
   - `peacefulNight`: Gentle crickets and night sounds
   - `calmDay`: Occasional single birds
   - `calmNight`: Soft crickets
   - `tense`: Sparse, unsettling low rumble or high pitch
   - `neutral`: Minimal ambient

3. Modified `update(dt, world)` to use `playEcosystemAmbient` instead of random biome selection

### Verified
- `npm run lint` — 0 errors, 0 warnings
- `npm test` — 146 passed, 0 failed

### Notes
- Volume stays low (0.08-0.2) to maintain subtle background presence
- Sound type varies by ecosystem health (healthy → peaceful chirping, tense → quiet/sporadic)
- Time of day affects sound (day birds vs night crickets)
- User can mute via existing `musicEnabled` toggle

## Session Audit (2026-04-15, Session 15 - Selection Pulse Feedback)

### Focus
Add satisfying ripple effect when clicking/selecting a creature.

### Changes

1. **creature-sim/src/input-pointer.js** — Added selection ripple effect on creature click:
   - When a creature is selected in inspect mode, call `world.particles.addImpactRing()` at creature position
   - Ripple uses blue tint `rgba(123, 183, 255, 1)` to match selection color scheme
   - Initial size of 6px expands to ~30px over 0.55s (existing ripple animation)
   - Combined with existing selection pulse (outline scales 1.0→1.25→1.0 over 400ms)

### Verified
- `npm run lint` — 0 errors, 0 warnings
- `npm test` — 146 passed, 0 failed

### Notes
- Selection ripple is quick and subtle (550ms duration, 400ms opacity fade)
- Uses existing particle system `addImpactRing` method for consistency
- Combined with existing `selectionPulseUntil` outline pulse for satisfying "pop" feel
- Ripple color matches selection outline color scheme (blue tint)

## Session Audit (2026-04-15, Session 14 - Tutorial Tooltips)

### Focus
Add hover tooltips explaining UI elements for new users.

### Changes

**tutorial-system.js:**
1. Added `TOOLTIP_CONFIG` constant with tooltip text and shortcuts for main UI elements:
   - `#ctrl-pause`: 'Pause or resume simulation' (Space)
   - `#ctrl-speed`: 'Adjust simulation speed' (1-4)
   - `#ctrl-food`: 'Paint food on the world' (F)
   - `#ctrl-spawn`: 'Spawn creatures' (S)
   - `#ctrl-watch`: 'Follow creatures automatically' (W)
   - `#ctrl-god`: 'God mode tools' (G)
   - `#ctrl-more`: 'More options menu' (M)
   - Watch mode and god mode tool buttons with their respective shortcuts

2. Added tooltip state management:
   - `tooltipsDismissed`: Set tracking dismissed tooltips
   - `_tooltipOverlay`: DOM element for tooltip container
   - `_tooltipElements`: Map of selector to tooltip element
   - `_hoverListeners`: Array of bound event listeners

3. Added `initTooltips()` method that creates tooltip overlay and binds listeners

4. Added `_createTooltipOverlay()` helper that creates the tooltip container

5. Added `_bindTooltipListeners()` that:
   - Iterates over TOOLTIP_CONFIG
   - Creates styled tooltip elements with text, shortcut key, and dismiss button
   - Positions tooltips above target elements
   - Shows on hover/focus, hides on mouse leave/blur
   - Handles dismiss button to permanently hide tooltip

6. Added `dismissTooltip(selector)` method that:
   - Adds selector to dismissed set
   - Hides the tooltip with animation
   - Persists dismissals to localStorage

7. Added `saveTooltipDismissals()` and `loadTooltipDismissals()` for localStorage persistence

8. Modified `start()` to initialize tooltips after tutorial completes or for returning users

9. Modified `complete()` to call `initTooltips()` after tutorial finishes

### Verified
- `npm run lint` — 0 errors, 0 warnings
- `npm test` — 146 passed, 0 failed

### Notes
- Tooltips appear on hover over control strip buttons, watch mode buttons, and god mode tools
- Each tooltip has a small × button to dismiss it permanently
- Dismissals are saved to localStorage so returning users don't see tooltips again
- Tooltips are non-intrusive: small text boxes that appear above elements
- Tutorial system initializes tooltips after completing or skipping the tutorial

## Session Audit (2026-04-15, Session 12 - Season Visual Transitions)

### Focus
Add smooth seasonal transitions for tree colors, ground colors, and decorations.

### Changes

   - Adjusts globalAlpha for seasonal fading

4. **renderer.js** — Modified `_drawDecorationFallback(dec, world)`:
   - Added `applyHsl()` helper to apply seasonal modifiers to all colors
   - Trees become bare/brown in autumn/winter
   - Flowers/grass fade based on season

5. **renderer.js** — Added `_getSeasonalGroundTint(season, phase)`:
   - Returns RGB tint factors for each season
   - Applied to biome color rendering for subtle ground color shifts

6. **renderer.js** — Enhanced `_drawSeasonOverlay(world)`:
   - Now interpolates between current and next season colors based on seasonPhase
   - Creates smooth transitions as seasons progress

### Verified
- `npm run lint` — 0 errors, 0 warnings
- `npm test` — 146 passed, 0 failed

### Notes
- Transitions are gradual over the season (uses seasonPhase 0-1)
- Tree foliage fades in autumn, becomes bare in late autumn/winter
- Flowers fade out in autumn/winter
- Ground gets subtle warm tints in spring/summer, cool in winter
- Season overlay interpolates between adjacent season colors

## Session Audit (2026-04-15, Session 11 - Social Hierarchy Visuals)

### Focus
Make alpha creatures (lineage founders) visually distinct with crown or glow effect.

### Changes

1. **creature-render.js** — Added `isAlphaCreature()` helper function that determines if a creature is a lineage founder (has no parentId or is the root of their lineage)
2. **creature-render.js** — Added alpha visual effects for lineage founder creatures:
   - Golden crown icon above the creature (3-point crown shape with pulsing animation)
   - Golden aura glow around alpha creatures (radial gradient from creature outward)
   - Crown uses shadowBlur for golden glow effect
   - Subtle pulsing animation synced to worldTime

### Verified
- `npm run lint` — 0 errors, 0 warnings
- `npm test` — 146 passed, 0 failed

### Notes
- Alpha status determined by lineage root (founder of family line)
- Crown positioned above creature at y = -r - 5 (above the body)
- Aura extends to 2x creature radius with soft golden gradient
- Does not dominate screen - subtle effect that communicates status

## Session Audit (2026-04-15, Session 10 - Emotion Contagion Visualization)

### Focus
Add visual effects showing fear spreading to nearby creatures when one is scared.

### Changes

1. **renderer-creatures.js** — Added `world` to `renderOpts` to enable creature proximity queries for fear contagion effect
2. **creature-render.js** — Added emotion contagion visualization when creature fear > 0.7:
   - Fear wave ripple rings expanding outward from scared creature (3 concentric rings, purple-tinted)
   - Contagion radius scales with fear level (80-120px)
   - Nearby creatures show subtle fear tint influenced by distance and source fear level
   - Effect only visible at zoom > 0.4 to avoid clutter

### Verified
- `npm run lint` — 0 errors, 0 warnings
- `npm test` — 146 passed, 0 failed

## Session Audit (2026-04-15, Session 13 - Weather Intensity Feedback)

### Focus

**game-loop.js:**
1. Added `_weatherParticleTimer` and `_weatherParticleInterval` (0.25s) for throttled emission
2. Added `_emitWeatherParticles()` method that emits weather particles in camera viewport:
   - Rain/storm: emits `weather_rain` particles scaled by intensity (storm 1.3x)
   - Storm > 0.4: also emits debris particles
   - Snow: emits `weather_snow` particles
   - Wind: emits `weather_wind` particles
3. Called `_emitWeatherParticles(dt)` in `step()` after world update

**renderer.js:**
1. Enhanced `_drawWeatherEffects()` with intensity-scaled screen effects:

- `npm run build` — succeeds in 180ms

## Session Audit (2026-04-15, Session 7 - Visual Polish)

### Focus
Implemented 12 major improvements across visuals, gameplay, performance, and UX.

### Changes

**Visual Improvements:**
1. **Particle system overhaul** (`particle-system.js`) — Added `category` property to all 20 particle types, replaced fragile `p.color.includes()` string matching with typed `p.category === ...` checks
2. **Sprite-based decorations** (`renderer.js`, `world-core.js`) — Enhanced procedural fallbacks with layered depth (tree foliage, rock highlights, flower petals, grass blades); added type-specific hue ranges for better visual variety
3. **Creature sprite animations** (`creature-render.js`, `world-creature-manager.js`) — Flying/burrowing creatures now use SVG sprites; added `creatureType` trait detection for sprite selection
4. **Post-processing bloom/glow** (`creature-render.js`, `particle-system.js`) — Added `shadowBlur` to fire (8), ice (6), electric (10), sparkle (6), food (5), and evolution (12) particle effects

**Gameplay Improvements:**
5. **Flying/burrowing behaviors** (`creature.js`, `creature-behavior.js`, `genetics.js`) — Flying creatures seek high elevation with swooping motion; burrowing creatures prefer underground with fear reduction
6. **Mutation visual diversity** (`creature-render.js`) — Added effects for Gigantism (power aura + ripples), Dwarfism (cute aura + stars), Albinism (UV glow + damage sparks), Melanism (night vision aura), Longevity (golden aura + rings), Accelerated Aging (decay aura), Super Senses (radar sweep), Photosynthesis (energy glow), Chimera (multi-color swirl)
7. **Nocturnal advantages** (`creature-agent-needs.js`, `creature.js`, `world-combat.js`, `creature-render.js`) — Nocturnal creatures gain 25% speed, 30% vision, 20% hunting bonus at night; diurnal creatures get 15% night penalty; enhanced nocturnal glow

**Performance Improvements:**
8. **Culling optimization** (`game-loop.js`) — Verified spatial grid culling already implemented; enhanced debug overlay with culling effectiveness metrics
9. **Particle pooling** (`object-pool.js`, `particle-system.js`) — Particle pool size increased to 2000; all particle creation uses pooled objects; fixed particle leak bug where dead particles weren't returned to pool

**Other Improvements:**
10. **Sprite caching** (`asset-loader.js`, `creature-render.js`) — Multi-zoom sprite caching at 5 levels (32, 48, 64, 96, 128px); nearest zoom level selected to minimize scaling
11. **Save system compression** (`save-system.js`, `main.js`) — gzip compression using browser's `CompressionStream` API; backward compatible with `C2:` prefix marker
12. **Tutorial system** (`event-system.js`, `ui-controller-spawn.js`, `tutorial-system.js`) — Added spawn step to tutorial; spawn tracking via events; persistent progress in localStorage

### Verified
- `npm run lint` — 0 errors, 0 warnings
- `npm test` — 146 passed, 0 failed
- `npm run build` — succeeds in 187ms

## Session Audit (2026-04-15, Session 5)

### Focus
Sprite Caching at Multiple Zoom Levels - pre-render creature sprites at multiple zoom levels to avoid re-tinting on every frame.

### Changes
- `creature-sim/src/asset-loader.js` — Added `ZOOM_SIZES = [32, 48, 64, 96, 128]` constant and `getNearestSpriteSize()` helper method for selecting nearest cached size
- `creature-sim/src/creature-render.js` — `updateCachedCanvas()`: replaced single-size (64px) caching with multi-size pre-caching at all 5 zoom levels into `creature._cachedSpriteSets`; color-invalidation guard still works correctly across all sizes; changed `console.error` to `console.debug` for expected async failures
- `creature-sim/src/creature-render.js` — `getCachedSpriteFrame()`: added `renderSize` parameter; selects nearest cached zoom level (smallest cached size >= renderSize, or largest available if none qualify) to minimize canvas scaling quality loss
- `creature-sim/src/creature-render.js` — `drawCreature`: factored out `renderSize = r * 4 * eatScale` computation before sprite draw to pass to `getCachedSpriteFrame()`

### Verified
- `npm run lint` — 0 errors, 0 warnings
- `npm test` — 146 passed, 0 failed

## Session Audit (2026-04-15, Session 4)

### Focus
Tutorial System - add "spawn creatures" step and proper spawn tracking.

### Changes
- `creature-sim/src/event-system.js` — Added `CREATURE_SPAWN: 'creature:spawn'` event for manual creature spawns
- `creature-sim/src/ui-controller-spawn.js` — Added import for `eventSystem` and `GameEvents`; emit `CREATURE_SPAWN` event after successful spawn with creatureId, type, and position
- `creature-sim/src/tutorial-system.js` — Added spawn step to `DEFAULT_STEPS` (after welcome, before camera); updated welcome text from "four" to "five" quick moves; added `spawn` listener tracking; added `trackSpawn()` method; added `spawn` case to `_progressWaitFor()` and `_resetProgressCounters()`

### Verified
- `npm run lint` — 0 errors, 1 warning (pre-existing in asset-loader.js)
- `npm test` — 146 passed, 0 failed

### Notes
- Tutorial system already existed but lacked spawn tracking and spawn step
- `CREATURE_SPAWN` event distinguishes user-initiated spawns from natural creature births (`CREATURE_BORN`)
- Tutorial dismisses on first successful spawn action via auto-advance timer

## Session Audit (2026-04-15)

### Focus
Save System Compression - reduce localStorage usage by compressing saves.

### Changes
- `creature-sim/src/save-system.js` — Added gzip compression using browser's built-in `CompressionStream` API:
  - Added `COMPRESSED_MARKER = 'C2:'` prefix for compressed data
  - Added `compressJson()` function: compresses JSON string to gzip, returns base64 with marker
  - Added `decompressJson()` function: detects compressed data via marker, decompresses gzip
  - Added `compressionEnabled` toggle (default: true) to SaveSystem
  - Modified `autoSave()`: now async, compresses before storing in localStorage
  - Modified `loadAutoSave()`: now async, auto-detects and decompresses if needed
  - Modified `saveToSlot()`: now async, compresses before storing
  - Modified `loadFromSlot()`: now async, auto-detects and decompresses if needed
  - Modified `saveToFile()`: now async, saves as .crsim file (compressed or uncompressed based on toggle)
  - Modified `loadFromFile()`: now async, auto-detects and decompresses if needed
- `creature-sim/src/main.js` — Updated callers to handle async methods:
  - `handleSaveToFile` is now async
  - Continue button click handler is now async to properly await `loadAutoSave`

### Verified
- `npm run lint` — 0 errors, 1 pre-existing warning (MAX_ZOOM_CACHE_PER_SPRITE unused)
- `npm test` — 146 passed, 0 failed
- Backward compatible: uncompressed saves load correctly (detected by missing `C2:` prefix)

### Notes
- Compression uses gzip via `CompressionStream` - available in all modern browsers
- Saves are marked with `C2:` prefix so uncompressed saves (from older versions) load fine
- `compressionEnabled` toggle allows disabling compression if needed for performance

## Session Audit (2026-04-16, Session 4)

### Focus
Particle Pooling - reduce GC pressure from particles by implementing object pooling.

### Changes
- `creature-sim/src/object-pool.js` — Enhanced `ParticlePool`: increased maxSize from 1000 to 2000, expanded factory/defaults to include all particle properties (type, category, opacity, twinkle, expandRate, targetX/Y, text, pulse, delay, fadeInTime, name, hue, label), comprehensive reset function clears all particle properties
- `creature-sim/src/particle-system.js` — Full pooling integration:
  - Added `import { poolManager }` for accessing shared pool
  - Added `_getPooledParticle()` / `_releaseParticle()` helper methods
  - Replaced all `this.particles.push({...})` calls with pooled particle acquisition in 20+ methods (birth, death, weather, combat, food, evolution, heal, season, disease, venom, eat, bond, panic, migration, nest, scarcity, mutation, territory, play, elder, bubbles, ripples, etc.)
  - `update()` now calls `_releaseParticle()` when particles die (before they were simply discarded - a leak)
  - `clear()` now releases all particles back to pool before clearing array
  - Added `_particleReleased` tracking counter
- `scripts/core-modules.test.mjs` — Fixed test to check for `opacity` instead of `alpha` (actual property used by particle system)

### Verified
- `npm run lint` — 0 errors, 0 warnings
- `npm test` — 146 passed, 0 failed (all tests pass)
- All particle effects should work identically, but particles are now recycled instead of garbage collected

## Session Audit (2026-04-16, Session 2)

### Focus
Sprite-based decorations integration: ensure decorations use sprite rendering when available with procedural fallback.

### Changes
- `creature-sim/src/world-core.js` — `generateDecorations()`: Added type-specific hue ranges (rocks: 20-50 for browns/grays, flowers: 0-360 full spectrum, trees: 80-130 greens, grass: 70-110 yellowish greens) instead of uniform 80-120 green range.
- `creature-sim/src/renderer.js` — `_drawDecorationFallback` tree: Improved with layered foliage circles, darker trunk, better depth.
- `creature-sim/src/renderer.js` — `_drawDecorationFallback` rock: Improved with additional highlight circle, darker base tones.
- `creature-sim/src/renderer.js` — `_drawDecorationFallback` flower: Enhanced with variable petal count based on hue, elliptical petals, layered center with highlight.
- `creature-sim/src/renderer.js` — `_drawDecorationFallback` grass: Enhanced with more blades, elliptical base clump, better lean variation.

### Verified
- `npm run lint` — 0 errors, 0 warnings
- `npm test` — 146 passed, 0 failed

## Session Audit (2026-04-16)

### Focus
Particle system overhaul: replace fragile string color matching with typed categories.

### Changes
- `creature-sim/src/particle-system.js` — Added `category` property to all particle types (sparkle, ring, dust, ghost, gravestone, sleep, weather/rain/snow/wind, blood, food, evolution, heal, season, disease, contagion, venom, bubble, ripple, play, elder, territory). Replaced fragile `p.color.includes(...)` checks in `draw()` with `p.category === ...` checks for rain/snow/wind weather particles. Backward compatible: color property preserved for existing particle creation code.

### Verified
- `npm run lint` — 0 errors, 0 warnings
- `npm test` — 146 passed, 0 failed

## Session Audit (2026-04-15)

### Focus
1. Culling optimization verification and debug display enhancement

### Changes
- `creature-sim/src/game-loop.js` — Enhanced debug overlay (`renderDebugOverlay`) to show spatial grid culling effectiveness: displays cull percentage, total objects vs rendered, and per-type counts (creatures/food/corpses) using aggregated `performance.stats`

### Verified
- `npm run lint` — 0 errors, 0 warnings
- `npm test` — 146 passed, 0 failed

### Analysis: Spatial Grid Culling (Already Implemented)
All culling already uses spatial grid queries:
- **Creatures**: `world.creatureManager.creatureGrid.queryRect()` (renderer-creatures.js:12-18)
- **Food**: `world.foodGrid.queryRect()` (renderer.js:1461)
- **Corpses**: `world.corpseGrid.queryRect()` (renderer.js:1550)

The `queryRect` method iterates only over grid cells intersecting the view bounds, providing O(1) broad-phase culling per cell with per-item precise culling. No changes to culling logic were needed.

## Session Audit (2026-04-15)

### Focus
1. Enhanced water biome rendering with layered caustics, animated waves, and light reflections
2. Enhanced bioluminescence glow effect with shadowBlur, sparkle particles, and night boost
3. Added eating animation (chomp effect) and hunting animation (aggressive pulse ring)
4. Bug sweep: fixed unused variable warnings and verified code quality
5. Wire up Flying/Burrowing creature sprites

### Changes
- `creature-sim/src/renderer.js` — Enhanced `_drawWaterBiomes()` with multi-layered caustic patterns (3 concentric circles with different drift speeds), animated shimmer sparkles (2 per cell at zoom > 0.7), light reflection streaks (zoom > 0.8), and better depth-based coloring (shallow/deep differentiation)
- `creature-sim/src/creature-render.js` — Enhanced bioluminescence glow: added `shadowBlur` for bloom-like effect, 5-stop radial gradient for richer glow, 4 animated sparkle particles orbiting the creature, inner and outer glow rings, night-time brightness boost via `dayLight` option
- `creature-sim/src/creature-render.js` — Added eating animation: creature body pulses (scales between 1.0-1.15) using sine wave over 0.5s cycle, procedural creatures show animated mouth (green circle that opens/closes at front)
- `creature-sim/src/creature-render.js` — Added hunting animation: predators with creature targets show dashed red pulsing ring around them (visible when zoomed in)
- `creature-sim/src/renderer.js` — Fixed bug: `_drawDecorationFromSprite` was referencing undefined `assetKey` variable (passed as parameter now)
- `creature-sim/src/renderer-creatures.js` — Removed unused `hue` variable
- `creature-sim/src/renderer.js` — Removed unused `ctx` variable in `_drawDecoration`
- `creature-sim/src/creature-render.js` — Added `creatureType` check to `assetType` determination: flying creatures use `creature_flying` sprite, burrowing creatures use `creature_burrowing` sprite (checked after age stage but before aquatic/alpha/diet checks)
- `creature-sim/src/world-creature-manager.js` — `spawnFlying()` now sets `creature.traits.creatureType = 'flying'`
- `creature-sim/src/world-creature-manager.js` — `spawnBurrowing()` now sets `creature.traits.creatureType = 'burrowing'`

### Verified
- `npm run lint` — 0 errors, 0 warnings (previously 0 errors, 2 warnings)
- `npm test` — 146 passed, 0 failed
- `npm run build` — succeeds in 277ms

## Session Audit (2026-04-14)

### Focus
1. Fix failing test (Creature constructor genes speed race condition)
2. Visual polish: creature spawn scale-in, death ghost particles, gravestone fade
3. Notification polish: species extinction milestones, first-event toasts, throttled checks
4. CSS polish: loading spinner, focus-visible, panel section dividers

### Changes
- `scripts/core-modules.test.mjs` — Fixed flaky test: set `sex: 'female'` to avoid male speed modifier making expressed genes nondeterministic (1.5 → 1.65).
- `creature-sim/src/creature.js` — Added `spawnTime`/`spawnScale` properties for smooth scale-in animation on birth (0→1 over 0.4s).
- `creature-sim/src/creature-render.js` — Applied spawn scale to creature drawing: scale transform + opacity fade during spawn animation.
- `creature-sim/src/particle-system.js` — Added ghost silhouette particle type on death (brief translucent shape that rises and fades). Enhanced gravestone with fade-in animation.
- `creature-sim/src/notification-system.js` — Added species extinction milestones (herbivore/predator extinct), first-event toasts ("Your ecosystem is growing!"), and `_lastPopulations`/`_firstEventToasts` tracking. Throttled checks.
- `creature-sim/src/game-loop.js` — Added throttled milestone check every 2 seconds in `updateSubsystems`. Added `_milestoneTimer` field.
- `creature-sim/styles.css` — Added CSS loading spinner, `creature-spawn` keyframe, `pulse-glow` keyframe, `focus-visible` outline for `.ctrl-btn`, and `.panel-section + .panel-section` dividers.

### Verified
- `npm test` — 146 passed, 0 failed (was 145 pass, 1 fail)
- `npm run lint` — 0 errors, 0 warnings
- `node -c` syntax checks pass on all modified files

## Session Audit (2026-04-13, Session 2)

### Focus
1. Add unit tests, Vite bundler, mobile panel fixes
2. Split large files into focused modules
3. Code quality fixes (debug globals, ECS cleanup)

### Changes
- Added 108 unit tests for core modules: utils.js, genetics.js, spatial-grid.js, object-pool.js, lineage-tracker.js (scripts/core-modules.test.mjs)
- Added Vite bundler: `npm run dev` (HMR), `npm run build` (prod), `npm run preview` — configured in vite.config.js, updated vercel.json, updated package.json scripts
- Fixed mobile panel overlap: inspector hidden transform, panel bottom offset +16px clearance, god-mode/moments panel bottom using CSS variable, added panel overlay backdrop with dismiss click handler
- Wrapped debug window.* globals behind devtools flag in main.js (lines 1442+)
- Removed ECS no-op from game-loop.js per-frame call

2. Fix all lint errors/warnings, remove dead code, upgrade dependencies.

### Changes
- `creature-sim/src/main.js` — Removed invalid `?v=20260413b` query strings from ES module imports (P0 blocker; would fail in strict module resolution).
- 29 source files — Auto-fixed 542 trailing whitespace + 29 indentation warnings via `npm run lint:fix`.
- `creature-sim/src/creature-behavior.js` — Removed unused `CreatureAgentTuning` import and unused `dist2` destructured import.
- `creature-sim/src/performance-profiler.js` — Removed unused `GameEvents` import.
- `creature-sim/src/enhanced-behaviors.js` — Removed unused `clamp` import.
- `creature-sim/src/disease-system.js` — Removed unused `rand`/`clamp` imports.

- 29 source files — Converted ~133 `console.log` → `console.debug` (excluded debug-console.js).
- `creature-sim/styles.css` — Added missing `--text-tertiary: #7a8299` variable; merged duplicate `.panel-close:hover` rules.
- `eslint.config.js` — Upgraded to ESLint 10 compat; changed `no-console` from `off` to `warn` (allowing warn/error/info/debug); added `varsIgnorePattern: '^_'` to `no-unused-vars`; added override for debug-console.js to allow `console.log`.
- `package.json` — Upgraded `eslint` from v9 to v10, `globals` from v15 to v17.

### Verified
- `npm test` — pass
- `npm run lint` — 0 errors, 0 warnings (down from 1,177)
- `node -c` syntax checks pass on all core files
- All 87 source files pass syntax validation

### Metrics
- Warnings reduced: 1,177 → 0 (100% resolution)
- Errors: 0 (was already 0)
- Dead imports removed: 8
- Dead assigned vars prefixed: 13
- Console.log → console.debug: ~133 conversions
- Dead batchRenderer code removed: 7 references
- Orphan comments removed: 4
- Camera clamping re-enabled (was disabled with "REMOVED" comments)
- 14 historical markdown files archived to docs/archive/

## Session Audit (2026-04-13, cont.)

### Camera drift fix
- `creature-sim/src/camera.js` — Re-enabled `_clampTargets()`, `_clampPosition()`, `_limits()`, and `_clampPoint()` with 200px margin. These were disabled with "REMOVED: No world boundaries" comments, causing the known camera drift bug.
- Clamping uses `worldWidth`/`worldHeight` plus a 200px margin so the camera stays within the world bounds while allowing slight overscroll.

### Dead code removal
- `creature-sim/src/game-loop.js` — Removed all batchRenderer dead code: `batchRendererReady = false`, `opts.batchRenderer = null`, `useBatchRendering` conditional, and commented-out flush block. Kept `useBatchRendering: false` in renderOptions for interface compatibility.
- `creature-sim/src/main.js` — Removed `// batchRenderer removed (stub)` comment and orphaned `// This block removed to prevent conflicts` comment block at EOF.

### Silent error fix
- `creature-sim/src/renderer.js` — Changed silent `.catch(() => {})` to `.catch((e) => { console.debug(...) })` for sprite load failures.

### Markdown cleanup
- Archived 14 historical markdown files from root to `docs/archive/`: AUTO_HIDE_OVERLAYS.md, COMPLETE_FEATURES.md, DEBUGGING.md, FULLSCREEN_FIX.md, IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md, MEMORY.md, MOBILE_OPTIMIZATION.md, PERFORMANCE.md, PHASE1_VERIFICATION.md, IMPROVEMENTS.md, UPGRADE_IDEAS.md, FUTURE_IDEAS.md, GAME_GUIDE.md, ARCHITECTURE.md.
- Root directory now contains only: README.md, PLAN.md, CHANGELOG.md, AGENT.md, claude.md

## Session Audit (2026-01-29)

### Focus

2. Trace spawn → store → render pipeline and fix root cause.
3. Update smoke tests + recovery report after verification.

## Session Audit (2026-02-09)

### Focus
1. Verify quick action controls behave as documented (food drop, spawn drawer toggles).
2. Fix season progression when day/night is toggled off.
3. Polish control strip accessibility state (pressed/expanded).

## Session Audit (2026-02-07)

### Focus
1. Verify baseline app behavior (home screen, New Sandbox, core loop) in browser.
2. Tune health, damage, and recovery for calmer, longer-lived creatures.
3. Reduce abrupt failures (impact/fall damage, hunger/stress spikes) and document balance values.
4. Update smoke tests and documentation after tuning.

## Session Fix (2026-01-28)

### Issue
Creatures not rendering after clicking "New Game" despite being spawned correctly.

### Root Cause
**Duplicate `<canvas id="view">` elements in index.html** (lines 34 and 862). Having two elements with the same ID causes `document.getElementById('view')` to potentially return the wrong canvas - the second one at line 862 had no styling and was not visible.

### Fix Applied
1. Removed duplicate `<canvas id="view"></canvas>` at line 862 of `index.html`
2. Added debug overlay toggle ('D' key) to help diagnose future rendering issues
   - Shows creature count, camera position, view bounds, canvas size, render stats
   - Added `showDebugOverlay` property to `game-state.js`
   - Added 'D' key handler in `input-manager.js`
   - Added `renderDebugOverlay()` method in `game-loop.js`

### Verification
- `node -c` syntax checks pass on all modified files
- Single canvas element confirmed with correct ID
- Debug overlay provides visibility into render pipeline state

### Files Changed
- `creature-sim/index.html` — Removed duplicate canvas element
- `creature-sim/src/game-loop.js` — Added debug overlay rendering
- `creature-sim/src/game-state.js` — Added showDebugOverlay property
- `creature-sim/src/input-manager.js` — Added 'D' key handler for debug toggle

## Session Debug (2026-01-26)

### Issue
Creatures not showing after clicking "New Game".

### Investigation
- Verified creature spawning works correctly (76 creatures created via `world.seed()`)
- Verified world initialization sequence is correct
- Verified renderer receives correct world reference
- No syntax errors in any JS files
- Save system tests pass

### Debug Logging Added
- `game-loop.js`: Log creature count and canvas size on first renders
- `renderer.js`: Log creatures passed to drawCreatures, view bounds, rendered vs culled counts

### Next Steps
- Check browser console for debug output after clicking "New Game"
- Identify if issue is: no creatures, all culled, or drawing failure

## Session Audit (2026-01-24)

### Focus
1. Bug check and polish pass across the codebase.
2. Fix lint errors and ensure all systems initialize correctly.
3. Polish controls for clearer tool state feedback.

### Changed
- `creature-sim/src/ui.js` — Fixed undefined `biome` variable in `renderSelectedInfo` by extracting biome from world at creature position.
- `creature-sim/src/ui-controller.js` — Added `updateToolIndicator()` method to show active tool state on quick action buttons with visual feedback; added tool:changed event listener. Fixed dropdown menus: removed auto-close timeouts that prevented item selection, converted buttons to toggle behavior, added `closeAllDropdowns()` helper, added global click handler to close dropdowns when clicking outside.
- `creature-sim/src/input-manager.js` — Emit `tool:changed` events when tool modes change via keyboard shortcuts.
- `creature-sim/styles.css` — Polished UI throughout:
  - Tool indicator label styling with pulse animation
  - Improved dropdown menus with checkmarks and better spacing
  - Enhanced stats display with tool indicator styling
  - Added panel slide-in/out animations and better close buttons
  - Mobile spawn sheet slide-up animation and selected checkmarks
  - Mobile action ripple feedback

- Inspector: custom scrollbar, section fade-in animation
- Watch mode: slide-up animation, better button hover/active states, improved moments panel
- Notifications: slide-in animation with fade, enhanced color palette
- Feature toggles: custom switch-style checkboxes and radio buttons
- Sliders: enhanced range inputs with filled track and glow effects
- Gene editor: custom scrollbar, improved gene slider layout
- Creature info card: improved metrics layout with borders, enhanced empty state
- Tooltips: fade-in animation, arrow pointer, better styling
- Modal dialogs: improved button active states, icon support, danger/success variants

## Session Audit (2026-01-29)

### Phase 1 Gameplay Audit (code inspection)
**Interactions too strong / inconsistent**
- Throw impulses use raw drag velocity with a high cap (420), leading to extreme launches.
- Bounce/spinner props and creature bump impulses stack high forces without weight scaling.
- External impulses ignore creature size, so larger creatures feel too light.

**Actions that dominate play**
- Rapid drag/throw can override normal locomotion, making props feel secondary.

**Systems lacking feedback or consequence**
- Collision reactions can trigger in rapid succession on bumps, reducing readability.
- Camera movement never fully settles due to tiny residual interpolation.

**Chaos: fun vs frustrating**
- Physics chaos is playful, but extreme launches and jittery camera transitions can feel unfair.

**Primary imbalance sources**
- Physics values: throw caps, prop strength, bump forces, impulse decay.
- Camera smoothing and movement thresholds.
- Touch thresholds for grab activation and pan sensitivity.

## Session Audit (2026-01-30)

### Focus
1. Health/damage tuning pass to reduce accidental deaths.
2. Ecosystem internal state loop (stress/energy/curiosity/stability) with emergent signals.
3. Save/load migration support for new creature state fields.

### Planned Actions
- Add tuning constants for health + damage thresholds/i-frames.
- Smooth combat damage and add attack cooldowns.
- Implement lightweight ecosystem state updates with crowd pressure + social contagion.
- Update save schema + smoke tests + docs.

## Session Audit (2026-02-01)

### Focus
1. Needs-driven creature agents (hunger/energy/social/stress) with utility goals.
2. Rest zones + food bite consumption with scent-based sensing.
3. Mating loop with cooldowns, population guardrails, and save/load support.

### Planned Actions
- Add centralized agent tuning constants and per-creature needs/goal state.
- Add rest zones and bite-based food consumption (local scent sensing).
- Update mating logic with controlled offspring + population caps.
- Extend save/load schema + docs + smoke tests for new agent loop.

## Session Audit (2026-01-26)

### Phase 1 Gameplay Audit (code inspection)
**What the player can do**
- Spawn, inspect, and erase creatures; paint food; pause/resume; adjust speeds.
- Toggle simulation features, pan/zoom camera, follow selected creature.
- Use gene editor, scenario lab, campaigns, and goals for longer-term play.

**World reactions**
- Creatures move, hunt, eat, reproduce, and die with visual/audio feedback.
- Selection glow, poke/drop reactions, and particle effects on events.
- Environmental seasons/weather, disasters, and ecosystem balancing.

**Choices that matter**
- Spawn/food placement affects population health and predator-prey balance.
- Gene edits affect traits and emergent survival.
- Tool usage (erase/spawn) and goal selection guide session direction.

### Gameplay dead zones
- Creature interaction is mostly observational after spawn (limited direct manipulation).
- Many UI actions (feature toggles) provide little immediate causal feedback.
- Sandbox lacks tactile props or environment rules for quick experiments.

### Missing affordances
- Drag/throw creatures or objects to test physics outcomes.
- Placeable props/zones (bounce, gravity, spinner) for emergent play.
- Clear contextual prompts for what to try next in the sandbox.

## Session Audit (2026-01-24)

### 10 most visible rough edges (inspection)
1. Overflow menu lacked in-context help after condensation.
2. Save/load hotkeys documented but not implemented for file downloads.
3. Selected creature card disappeared entirely when nothing was selected.
4. Icon-only quick actions relied on hover tooltips (not visible on mobile).
5. Mobile pan/zoom felt overly sensitive and jittery.
6. Mobile keyboard could cover inputs in panels.
7. Ecosystem health updated every frame (overkill on mobile).
8. Pointer move path created new objects each event.
9. Export actions had no confirmation feedback.
10. Menu mapping for condensed HUD was not visible in-app.

### Top 3 performance hotspots (inspection)
1. Per-frame ecosystem health recalculation in `GameLoop.updateSubsystems`.
2. Frequent UI updates for stats/selected info even when unchanged.
3. Pointer move allocations during continuous panning.

## Session Audit (2026-01-25)

### Focus
1. Creature feel upgrades (personality reactions + selection feedback).
2. Session nudges for manual spawns.
3. Home screen tone polish.

## Next

- [ ] Expand ECS stub for batch processing if needed
- [ ] Prototype creature presets panel for sandbox quick starts

## Done

### 2026-04-13 (Vite setup)

- Changed: `vite.config.js` — Created Vite config with root=creature-sim, server port 8000, build outDir=../dist, emptyOutDir=true.
- Changed: `package.json` — Added vite as devDependency; replaced python http.server scripts with `vite`, `vite build`, `vite preview`; kept existing `test` and `lint` scripts.
- Changed: `creature-sim/index.html` — Removed `?v=20260413b` cache-busting query strings from `<script>` and `<link>` tags (Vite handles cache busting via hashed filenames).
- Changed: `vercel.json` — Changed `buildCommand` to `npm run build`, `outputDirectory` to `dist`, updated JS header path from `/src/` to `/assets/`.
- Verified: `npm run build` — 83 modules transformed, built in 578ms.
- Verified: `npm run lint` — 0 errors, 0 warnings.
- Verified: `node scripts/core-modules.test.mjs` — 108/108 passed.
- Verified: `npm test` — Save system tests passed.

### 2026-04-13

- Changed: 8 source files — Removed dead unused imports (CreatureAgentTuning, GameEvents, clamp, rand, dist2, CreatureTuning).
- Changed: 6 source files — Prefixed assigned-but-unused vars with `_` (baseSpeed, speedScalar, predatorSpeed, panicLevel, etc.).
- Changed: 29 source files — Converted ~133 `console.log` → `console.debug` (excluded debug-console.js).
- Changed: 29 source files — Auto-fixed 542 trailing whitespace + 29 indentation warnings.
- Changed: `creature-sim/styles.css` — Added missing `--text-tertiary` CSS variable; merged duplicate `.panel-close:hover`.
- Changed: `creature-sim/src/world-core.js`, `world-events.js` — Changed `catch (__)` → `catch {}`.
- Changed: `eslint.config.js` — ESLint 10 compat; `no-console` warn (allow debug/warn/error/info); `varsIgnorePattern: '^_'`; debug-console.js override.
- Changed: `package.json` — Upgraded eslint v9→v10, globals v15→v17.
- Verified: `npm test` pass, `npm run lint` 0 errors / 76 warnings (down from 1,177), `node -c` all core files pass.

### 2026-01-26

- Changed: `creature-sim/src/creature-behavior.js` — kept vision-cone food selection inside `seekFood()` and removed stray code that caused a syntax error.
- Verified: `npm test` (pass; npm env warning about http-proxy), `npm run lint` (fails with 3 errors, 1040 warnings pre-existing).
- Notes: Lint errors persist in existing files (e.g., `creature-sim/src/biome-interactions.js`) and need a separate cleanup pass.
